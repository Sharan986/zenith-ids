## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `users` | User profiles with roles (student, industry, college, admin) |
| `roadmaps` | Learning paths with title and description |
| `skills` | Individual skills within roadmaps |
| `tasks` | Challenges linked to skills with points |
| `submissions` | Student work submissions with status |

### Key Relationships

```
roadmaps (1) ──── (n) skills
skills   (1) ──── (n) tasks
tasks    (1) ──── (n) submissions
users    (1) ──── (n) submissions
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Roles

Vouch uses Supabase Auth with role-based access control:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Student** | View roadmaps, submit tasks, track progress |
| **Industry** | Create tasks, review submissions, view leaderboard |
| **College** | Monitor student progress, view analytics |
| **Admin** | Full platform access |

Middleware automatically redirects users to their role-specific dashboard.

- **Nodes** = Skills (clickable to view tasks)
